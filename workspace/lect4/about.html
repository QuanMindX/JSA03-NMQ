            <h1>What is Mooncake?</h1>
            A delicacy that comes under the dessert category, Mooncakes are very famous and have been a significant part
            of China’s Moon Festival or the Mid-Autumn festival. These are analogous to Halloween Candy offered while
            you wish people moon festival greetings. It is gifted and shared between friends and family. The tradition
            of eating mooncakes is laced with mid autumn festival legend. Throughout thousands of years, ever since the
            mooncakes have been in existence, they have been offered to the Moon Goddess Chang’e (Chinese: 嫦娥,
            unofficially Chang-Er or Chang-o). The happy mid autumn festival wishes and celebrations have crossed
            borders. Now signature delicacies are available in abundance for celebrating the mid autumn festival in
            Philippines and other asian countries.

            There are various mid autumn festival deserts like the Japanese mooncake mochi, but none come close to the
            Mooncake. There are countless types of Mooncakes that combine a sweet pastry on the outside, and a dense
            filling of red bean paste or lotus seed paste on the inside. The lotus seed paste is very expensive, so
            people sometimes use white kidney bean paste to substitute. Red bean paste is often confused with jujube
            paste which is also used to fill cakes. While red bean paste is sweet, the jujube paste is a little sour to
            taste.

            The outer pastry can be dense, flaky or chewy. The chewy crust is the most common and has a shiny glaze. To
            symbolise the full Moon, salty duck eggs are also used in them, so when you cut into the mooncake, you can
            see the moon shape.

            The top of the mooncakes is decorated with various designs, which are usually symbols of harmony and
            longevity. These symbols can be any character from the festival’s legend, right from the Moon Goddess to the
            Jade Rabbit.

            What Does The Mooncake Symbolise?
            Mooncakes are a mid autumn festival custom which are shaped round symbolising completeness and togetherness
            of the family. The Full Moon on the day of the festival indicates family reunion and wealth. In today’s
            time, Chinese families exchange mooncakes for respecting the bond they share and let it be the same for
            years to come. The mid autumn festival Beijing is an occasion to attract numerous visitors to China from
            global locations.

            What Is Written On Mooncakes?
            This mid autumn festival foods are so popular that they are now commercialised largely. Hence, if the
            mooncakes are bought from a bakery, its bakery’s logo or name can be found on top of them. But if they’re
            being made at home, there are stamps available to imprint designs on the mooncakes. The imprints are mostly
            Chinese characters representing harmony and fortune to those who eat them.

            Other than these characters, there can also be designs of the Moon Goddess, the Jade Rabbit, flowers and
            vines.
